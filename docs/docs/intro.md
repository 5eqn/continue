## Quickstart

1. Try out Continue in the [GitHub Codespaces Demo](./getting-started.md)
2. Install Continue packaged as a [VS Code extension](./install.md)

## What is Continue?

**Continue is the open-source library for accelerating software development with language models**

You determine when Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 should act as an autopilot, helping you complete software development tasks. You use recipes created by others to automate more steps in your workflows. If a recipe does not exist or work exactly like you want, you can use the Continue SDK to create custom steps and compose them into personalized recipes. Whether you are using a recipe created by yourself or someone else, you can review, reverse, and rerun steps with the Continue GUI, which helps you guide the work done by LLMs and learn when to use and trust them.

## Why do developers use Continue?

Many developers have begun to use [GPT-3.5](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5) and [GPT-4](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4) through [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) while coding; however, the experience is painful because of how much manual copying, pasting, and editing is required to provide the necessary context and incorporate the generated solutions into your codebase. Continue eliminates this pain by deeply integrating LLMs into your IDE amd workflows.

Continue accelerates how developers build, ship, and maintain software, while giving them the control to define when LLMs should take actions and the confidence to trust LLMs. In short, it enables developers to do what they have always done: work together to create better and better abstractions that make it easier and easier to automate the repetitive work that people want computers to do.
