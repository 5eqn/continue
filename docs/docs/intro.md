**Continue is the open-source autopilot for software developmentâ€”a [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Continue.continue) that brings the power of ChatGPT to your IDE**

You determine when Large Language Models (LLMs) like [GPT-4](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4) should act as an autopilot, helping you complete software development tasks. You highlight some code and then use slash commands like `/edit` and `/explain` + natural language instructions to tell the language model what to do.

Many developers have begun to use [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) while coding; however, the experience is painful because of how much copying, pasting, and editing is required to provide the context and incorporate the generated answers into your codebase. Continue eliminates this pain by enabling LLMs to natively act in your IDE as you complete your workflows.
