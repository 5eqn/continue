# Introduction

## Quickstart

1. Try out `Continue` in the [GitHub Codespaces Demo](./getting-started.md)
2. Install `Continue` packaged as a [VS Code extension](./install.md)

## What is `Continue`?

**`Continue` is the open-source library for accelerating software development with language models**

You define the scenarios where Large Language Models ([LLMs](./concepts/llm.md)) like GPT-4 and StarCoder should act as an autopilot, helping you complete software development tasks. You use [recipes](./concepts/recipe.md) created by others to automate more steps in your workflows. If a [recipe](./concepts/recipe.md) does not exist or work exactly like you want, you can use the [Continue SDK](./concepts/sdk.md) to create custom [steps](./concepts/step.md) and compose them into personalized [recipes](./concepts/recipe.md). Whether you are using a [recipe](./concepts/recipe.md) created by yourself or someone else, you can review, reverse, and rerun [steps](./concepts/step.md) with the [Continue GUI](./concepts/gui.md), which helps you guide the work done by LLMs and learn when to use and trust them.

## Why do developers use `Continue`?

Many developers have begun to use models like [GPT-4](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4) through [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) while coding; however, the experience is painful because of how much manual copying, pasting, and editing is required to supply them with context and transfer the generated solutions to your codebase. `Continue` eliminates this pain by deeply integrating LLMs into your IDE amd workflows.

`Continue` accelerates how developers build, ship, and maintain software, while giving them the control to define when LLMs should take actions and the confidence to trust LLMs. In short, it enables developers to do what they have always done: work together to create better and better abstractions that make it easier and easier to automate the repetitive work that people want computers to do.
