As with any machine learning model, ChatGPT is only able to regurgitate what's been fed into it. Also, this behaviour happens with basically every other topic, too. LLMs work by trying to predict what the next word in a sentence would be based on the previous string of words. If a sentence is incomplete, it's going to add a next word. That word is going to be whichever has the highest confidence score, regardless of low that score may actually be. This results in it just making shit up, but often shit that sounds plausible. We've seen CGPT invent academic articles, books, and even entire people because it makes sense to in the sentence it's generating.`",u/Kichae,https://www.reddit.com/r/Julia/comments/112wlle/comment/j8mpgx5/,"I suspect the current language model behind ChatGPT was fed with a lot of code examples from Stack Exchange, but the Julia community mainly uses Discourse instead, which probably wasn't in the training set: https://discourse.julialang.org/",u/Paravalis,https://www.reddit.com/r/Julia/comments/112wlle/comment/j8qzc0j/

It sucks for Clojure but can be great for other languages like Python, JavaScript, SQL, etc. if you know how to prompt it. As other have mentioned, Copilot excels at reducing boilerplate and picking up on patterns. For example, lets say there is a table of data in a markdown document and you want to convert it to a vector of maps. You can copy/paste the markdown table into your buffer as a comment and just start writing the data structure you want it to be, Copilot will figure it out and complete it. Its also useful for generating random utility functions. Recently in JavaScript, I typed `function lerp` (linear interpolation) and it pretty quickly filled it in. I had an array of hex color values that I wanted to be RGB and I wanted to double the number of values by interpolating between them. All I had to do was type that in a comment and wait a second before it gave me a working rough draft of the function. Copilot can actually do a lot of these things for Clojure but when I was trying to use it I found myself consistently having to fix issues with delimiters, typically round braces. Eventually, I just gave up on it. Maybe I'll give it another shot when Copilot-X releases. ChatGPT is much more useful for Clojure than Copilot. It does hallucinate and get some things wrong but overall its awesome for generating documentation, explaining code, translating diffs into PR notes, and exploring ideas. I've found it very useful for random Java questions and then translating the answers into mostly working Clojure code. These things are handy tools and have quirks but they're going to get better. It's a great time to be a cosmopolitan (polyglot) programmer.",u/noprompt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Clojure/comments/148nhuj/comment/jo2z2n8,"No Clojure. No Julia. No Haskell. No Racket. No Scheme.

I actually enjoyed doing these little experiments. However, compared to other experiments I did with JavaScript and other languages, a clear takeaway from my efforts is that when it comes to the Web3 space, GPT doesn’t yet have enough accuracy. In fairness, there is far less available Solidity and Web3-related JavaScript code in the wild than there is general-purpose JavaScript code. Plus, the web3 industry is constantly changing, which makes the problems of ChatGPT relying on an old dataset much worse. . On the positive side, generating an ABI from Solidity is something it did well, which shows it can learn from the available snippets the general rules to create something new.",Lorenzo Sicilia,https://outlierventures.io/article/can-chatgpt-really-be-trusted-to-write-a-smart-contract-or-to-refactor-your-existing-solidity-code/,Can someone please make an open coder model trained on Solidity,u/thatdudeiknew,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/14qednx/comment/jqmq2t5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3
