It sucks for Clojure but can be great for other languages like Python, JavaScript, SQL, etc. if you know how to prompt it. As other have mentioned, Copilot excels at reducing boilerplate and picking up on patterns. For example, lets say there is a table of data in a markdown document and you want to convert it to a vector of maps. You can copy/paste the markdown table into your buffer as a comment and just start writing the data structure you want it to be, Copilot will figure it out and complete it. Its also useful for generating random utility functions. Recently in JavaScript, I typed `function lerp` (linear interpolation) and it pretty quickly filled it in. I had an array of hex color values that I wanted to be RGB and I wanted to double the number of values by interpolating between them. All I had to do was type that in a comment and wait a second before it gave me a working rough draft of the function. Copilot can actually do a lot of these things for Clojure but when I was trying to use it I found myself consistently having to fix issues with delimiters, typically round braces. Eventually, I just gave up on it. Maybe I'll give it another shot when Copilot-X releases. ChatGPT is much more useful for Clojure than Copilot. It does hallucinate and get some things wrong but overall its awesome for generating documentation, explaining code, translating diffs into PR notes, and exploring ideas.

It's barfing out examples it was trained on with no idea about what they do, whether they work, and if they are current. Transaction objects no longer have a success method. This was deprecated for a long time ago and finally removed in version 9. The error method returns a single value. Minor problem, but still cruft that shouldn't be there. Call json on the response to get the data structure rather than doing this yourself. Even then, using JSON directly, while fine, skips over the Mojo::JSON::decode_json. It's a bit of a pain in the butt, but work hard to use the same parser everywhere in an application since they tend to have slight differences (say, like how they represent null, true, or false). Somewhere along the line, ChatGPT saw this code or something very similar. It then returns it to you with no intelligence about what it is doing or what it should do. It's very likely that the source ChatGPT saw is not only old, but also unsophisticated. You're likely just cargo-culting off StackOverflow with extra steps.

IMO, this is quite irrelevant, because you must understand that whatever output - be it code, poems or whatever - from an AI-assisted service is not perfect. The main point is: it helps. And that's its main selling point today, because that's how StackOverflow also works: sometimes it's perfect, but most of the times it just helps, maybe because you have addressed the wrong audience, didn't word your question/problem correctly or otherwise. With ChatGPT you get an instant reply, and you can ask it to refine its reply. Instantly. Rinse and repeat.

But converting the function signatures is much harder to automate, especially third-party ones. I am currently in the process of doing Matlab to python for code relying on third-party packages, and it is certainly time consuming, but there isn't much alternative.",u/TheBlackCat13,https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/158l86g/comment/jtb1g61/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3,"Why would you think such a simple plot with callback on click would not work? Now I wonder if it made the callback zoom-safe. I was using update callbacks after only 8 months of college experience with Matlab.

It's nowhere near replacing my job yet but it's saved me countless hours on some rather trivial but tedious tasks. Most recent today was a function that converts a string to camel case, worked perfectly right out of the gate. Yea I probably could have found the same function on google in 10 min, but I would have had to comb through ads, and useless posts on stack overflow, before I found one I knew would be performant. It's not laziness, the rest of my job is busy enough, I could have spent an hour or two figuring out the logic from scratch but simply put, this is a far more efficient use of my time.",u/Ch33kyMnk3y,https://www.reddit.com/r/dotnet/comments/10s8eld/comment/j704bu4/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3,"Yeah, I just use the free version but I'll ask it to do something, it kinda does it, I ask, ""Is this part necessary?"" It then responds with oh you're right and redoes it but in a way that still has questions, like I wanted it to explain why it did something the way it did and it takes that as I'm saying it's not really needed. Then I ask it to explain the new changes and it reverts things to the way it did them before thinking I spotted an error in how it redid the code. 🤦‍♂️ I still think it's a nice option to springboard learning or get quick explanations of things with examples, but the more I've used it the less I'm convinced it'll be stealing my job anytime soon.

If you want to test or play around it will create a dataframe example. Also if you know one programming language it can help translate. It will even rewrite the code to look better. E.g. write this code in python pandas but make it more readable like r dplyr. Anything regex is nice as I don't have to hope a specific example is on stack overflow. Chat cpt from my experience will often favor going things with for loops instead of taking advantage of dplyr or pandas functions. With everything chat gpt tho check the code as it will confidently give you an answer and even print out a fake output. Often pointing out its error gets chatgpt to fix the code.,u/2truthsandalie,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rlanguage/comments/17q56xq/comment/k8b2phr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3,"I have found it hit and miss.
