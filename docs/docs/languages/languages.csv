It sucks for Clojure but can be great for other languages like Python, JavaScript, SQL, etc. if you know how to prompt it. As other have mentioned, Copilot excels at reducing boilerplate and picking up on patterns. For example, lets say there is a table of data in a markdown document and you want to convert it to a vector of maps. You can copy/paste the markdown table into your buffer as a comment and just start writing the data structure you want it to be, Copilot will figure it out and complete it. Its also useful for generating random utility functions. Recently in JavaScript, I typed `function lerp` (linear interpolation) and it pretty quickly filled it in. I had an array of hex color values that I wanted to be RGB and I wanted to double the number of values by interpolating between them. All I had to do was type that in a comment and wait a second before it gave me a working rough draft of the function. Copilot can actually do a lot of these things for Clojure but when I was trying to use it I found myself consistently having to fix issues with delimiters, typically round braces. Eventually, I just gave up on it. Maybe I'll give it another shot when Copilot-X releases. ChatGPT is much more useful for Clojure than Copilot. It does hallucinate and get some things wrong but overall its awesome for generating documentation, explaining code, translating diffs into PR notes, and exploring ideas.

It's barfing out examples it was trained on with no idea about what they do, whether they work, and if they are current. Transaction objects no longer have a success method. This was deprecated for a long time ago and finally removed in version 9. The error method returns a single value. Minor problem, but still cruft that shouldn't be there. Call json on the response to get the data structure rather than doing this yourself. Even then, using JSON directly, while fine, skips over the Mojo::JSON::decode_json. It's a bit of a pain in the butt, but work hard to use the same parser everywhere in an application since they tend to have slight differences (say, like how they represent null, true, or false). Somewhere along the line, ChatGPT saw this code or something very similar. It then returns it to you with no intelligence about what it is doing or what it should do. It's very likely that the source ChatGPT saw is not only old, but also unsophisticated. You're likely just cargo-culting off StackOverflow with extra steps. But, this also isn't the way you probably want to write code. You don't want to return the token really, You want to add that to the user-agent so it provides it in every request without additional code from you. I have plenty of examples in Mojo Web Clients.

IMO, this is quite irrelevant, because you must understand that whatever output - be it code, poems or whatever - from an AI-assisted service is not perfect. The main point is: it helps. And that's its main selling point today, because that's how StackOverflow also works: sometimes it's perfect, but most of the times it just helps, maybe because you have addressed the wrong audience, didn't word your question/problem correctly or otherwise. With ChatGPT you get an instant reply, and you can ask it to refine its reply. Instantly. Rinse and repeat. So if it use StackOverflow data (which I assume it does) it's already better in the sense that it's instant and filters out noise, especially personal attacks, or otherwise replies that intimidates the person asking the questions.
