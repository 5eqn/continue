# Collecting data

You might have noticed the `Data Collection` toggle at the bottom of the Continue GUI. If you turn it on, it automatically collects accepted and rejected suggestions, so you can fine-tune an LLM to give better answers.

Right now, it stores them in a JSON file on your computer. Going forward, we plan to enable you to join them with data from other developers on your team and help you fine-tune an LLM to better follow your team's best practices.

If you are interested in working with us to fine-tune models based on your coding data, reach out to hi@continue.dev!
