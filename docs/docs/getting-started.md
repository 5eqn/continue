# Getting started

## GitHub Codespaces Demo

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/continuedev/continue-codespaces-demo?quickstart=1)

1. Click the `Open in GitHub Codespaces` badge above

:::tip
We don't want to waste your time with install and env setup before you try Continue, so we set up a GitHub Codespace for you, which **wonâ€™t cost you anything**. If you are using GitHub Free for personal accounts, you can [use Codespaces for 120 hours per month for free](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces#monthly-included-storage-and-core-hours-for-personal-accounts)

2. Select the `Create new codespace` button and wait a couple minutes while it launches and installs the Continue extension. Once complete, it should look like this:

**TODO: Insert an image of Continue when it has opened**

3. Try playing with Continue as you write some Python code to understand a dataset with Pandas

**TODO: Design and set up Pandas stuff scenario in codespaces**

4. There are a few recipes you should also try
   a. In the first directory, try out Pytest recipe
   b. In the second directory, try out Write comments for the highlighted code recipe
   c. In the third directory, try out dlt CreatePipeline recipe

**TODO: Design and add these recipes in codespaces**

## Next Steps

If you're ready to use Continue locally, install `Continue` packaged as a VS Code extension, as described [here](./install.md).
