# Getting started

## Download for VS Code

1. Download on the VS Code Extension Marketplace [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Continue.continue).

2. Once downloaded, the extension will take about 30 seconds to load, and then you can open the left sidebar, as seen below.

3. If it's your first time using Continue, it will open a file called `calculator.py` where you can play around with Continue's functionality.
