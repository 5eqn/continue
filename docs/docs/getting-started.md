# Getting started

## Recommended: Install in VS Code

:::note
Continue requires that you have Python 3.8 or greater. If you do not, please [install](https://python.org) it
:::

1. Click `Install` on the **[Continue extension in the Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Continue.continue)**

2. This will open the Continue extension page in VS Code, where you will need to click `Install` again

3. Once you do this, you will see a message in the bottom right hand corner of VS Code that says `Setting up Continue extension...`. After 30-90 seconds, the Continue extension will then open up:

![vscode-install](/img/continue-screenshot.png)

4. If it's your first time using Continue, it will open a file called `calculator.py` with instructions:

![codespaces-install](/img/continue-screenshot2.png)

5. Try using it with your own code!

## Alternative: GitHub Codespaces

If you would like to try without installing on your machine, you can [open our GitHub Codespace](https://codespaces.new/continuedev/continue-codespaces-demo?quickstart=1) to play with Continue in a browser-based editor
