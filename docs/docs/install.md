## Install `Continue` locally in VS Code

2. This will open the `Continue` extension page in VS Code, where you will need to click `Install` again

3. Once you do this, you will see a message in the bottom right hand corner of VS Code that says `Setting up Continue extension...`. After a couple minutes, the `Continue` extension will then open up
